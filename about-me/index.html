    <h1>About Me</h1>
  </header>
  <p>Hi! I am Gareth, aka grhkm online. Hongkonger ðŸ‡­ðŸ‡° and currently studying maths at University of Warwick ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§. Interested in maths, cryptography (abbr. crypto), rhythm games, philosophy, indie and rock music. Currently looking for internship positions and research opportunities. Please contact me if you have any opportunities! I can provide my CV upon request.</p>
<p>This blog mainly contains writeups for interesting CTF and other algorithmic problems, but I plan to write some random blogs as well (someone suggested a song recommendation blog).</p>
<p>You can also find me on <a href="htts://infosec.exchange/@grhkm/">Mastodon</a> at @grhkm@infosec.exchange, where I post about all kinds of stuff, mostly programming projects and CTF results.</p>

<ul>
<li>My absolute favorite band is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzQEX7n0LDZ-UkJx6suwQEg">After Tales</a>. They are a Hong Kong-based band, producing music influenced by western pop, J-rock, cantopop and more. I got a signed CD from them during summer of 2022, and you can&rsquo;t imagine how happy I was!</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qY22HPfafSQ">Once</a>, recently listening to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KR3Ct2KjB20">IVE</a></li>

<li>Mystiz is an experienced member of Black Bauhinia (many more years of experience than me). I thought he is good at Crypto, but he is definitely more than that.</li>
<li>I first met him on Cryptohack where he invited me to his Hong Kong CTF team. I am very fortunate to have met him (virtually for now). He is essentially how I got <em>really</em> interested in cryptography, and without him, I will probably still be searching for possible career paths. Can&rsquo;t wait to solve more CTF problems and continue vibing together!</li>

<li>She makes really high quality videos on crypto, pwn/vulnerabilities, web, and more. I first learned and understood lattice-based attacks from her <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uktq1RYVtbo">video</a>. Be sure to check it out!</li>

<ul>
<li>He has some really high quality writeups, and every crypto player should read his <a href="https://rkm0959.tistory.com/220?category=765103">article</a> named &ldquo;Inequality Solving with CVP&rdquo;.</li>

<li><strong>Cousin&rsquo;s Blog: <a href="https://klwu.co/">https://klwu.co/</a></strong>
<ul>
<li>Also known as the Kirby guy, he has many well-explained articles on Elliptic Curves and Lattice-based Cryptography. He has a cool demonstration of the Babai&rsquo;s algorithm <a href="https://klwu.co/demo/lattice-demo-1/">here</a>.</li>

<ul>
<li>I was initially introduced to him as one of the authors of IrisCTF, particularly for the network, RF and forensics challenges. As someone primarily interested in cryptography, I wasn&rsquo;t initially interested in the challenges. However, he was very supportive in helping contestants with RF tooling issues, and I love his passion with the topic. I highly recommend giving his blogs a read!</li>
