Hi! I am Gareth, aka grhkm online. Hongkonger ðŸ‡­ðŸ‡° and currently studying maths at University of Warwick ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§. Interested in maths, cryptography (abbr. crypto), rhythm games, philosophy, indie and rock music. I am particularly interested in cryptanalysis, lattice-based and isogeny-based schemes within cryptography.

This blog mainly contains writeups for interesting CTF and other algorithmic problems, but I plan to write some random blogs as well (someone suggested a song recommendation blog).

You can also find me on [Mastodon](htts://infosec.exchange/@grhkm/) at @grhkm@infosec.exchange, where I post about all kinds of stuff, mostly programming projects and CTF results.

### Some random facts about me...

-   My absolute favorite band is [After Tales](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzQEX7n0LDZ-UkJx6suwQEg). I love them so much I got a signed CD from them in-person too ahhhhhh 
-   I'm a [bunny](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUNz-uTF--E) I love [newjeans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtl8b7H4kEo) so much you have [no idea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2rhxpFVecs) omg stan [Hanni](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-0VvIKT0L0) plz [pure talent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZ1woOvhEDE)!!!
-   [PE #2 HK / #266 Global](https://projecteuler.net/location=Hong_Kong), [CH #1 HK / #21 Global](https://cryptohack.org/scoreboard/), [JS #54 HK](https://jstris.jezevec10.com/sprint?display=10)
-   I type pretty [fast](/images/wpm.png), [#419 Global](https://monkeytype.com/profile/grhkm).

### Not sure where to start? Check out these articles:

-   [Modular Forms](/posts/modular-forms), modular forms learning notes
-   Lagrange Interpolation, pt. [1](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/82953) and [2](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/94143)
-   [DiceCTF LWE](/posts/dice-learning-without-errors), a challenge about performing a key recovery attack on the CKKS scheme
-   [hkcert Unobserved Box](/posts/hkcert-unobserved-box), a pwn + rev challenge that required chaining format string vulnerability to leak the binary to then reverse the binary

### If you like my blog, you might also like...

-   **Mystiz's Blog: [https://mystiz.hk/](https://mystiz.hk/)**
    -   Mystiz is an experienced member of Black Bauhinia (many more years of experience than me). I thought he is good at Crypto, but he is definitely more than that.
    -   I first met him on Cryptohack where he invited me to his Hong Kong CTF team. I am very fortunate to have met him (virtually for now). He is essentially how I got _really_ interested in cryptography, and without him, I will probably still be searching for possible career paths. Can't wait to solve more CTF problems and continue vibing together!
-   **kurenaif's Channel: [https://www.youtube.com/c/kurenaif](https://www.youtube.com/c/kurenaif)**
    -   She makes really high quality videos on crypto, pwn/vulnerabilities, web, and more. I first learned and understood lattice-based attacks from her [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uktq1RYVtbo). Be sure to check it out!
-   **rkm0959's Blog: [https://rkm0959.tistory.com/category/CTF](https://rkm0959.tistory.com/category/CTF)**
    -   He has some really high quality writeups, and every crypto player should read his [article](https://rkm0959.tistory.com/220?category=765103) named "Inequality Solving with CVP".
-   **Cousin's Blog: [https://klwu.co/](https://klwu.co/)**
    -   Also known as the Kirby guy, he has many well-explained articles on Elliptic Curves and Lattice-based Cryptography. He has a cool demonstration of the Babai's algorithm [here](https://klwu.co/demo/lattice-demo-1/).
-   **skat's Blog: [https://shawnd.xyz/](https://shawnd.xyz/)**
    -   I was initially introduced to him as one of the authors of IrisCTF, particularly for the network, RF and forensics challenges. As someone primarily interested in cryptography, I wasn't initially interested in the challenges. However, he was very supportive in helping contestants with RF tooling issues, and I love his passion with the topic. I highly recommend giving his blogs a read!
