      <description>(Up-)Solved by: grhkm
Source of the problem: Dice CTF 2022
Self-Reflection I am actually very frustrated and annoyed at myself for this problem. During the CTF I was scared off by my lack of experience with this encryption scheme, and also just didn&amp;rsquo;t believe I can solve this challenge. As a result, I spent a lot of my time watching YouTube instead.
Approaching the end of the CTF, for absolutely no reason I decided I will try to take a look at the challenge.</description>

      <description>Introduction Our team Black Bauhinia participated in the TetCTF 2022 which spans two days. Algebra is the hardest Crypto challenge in the CTF. Mystiz and I (grhkm) together spent around 7 hours on this challenge.
Problem Statement  Description: I threw some arbitrary operator into a finite field and, interestingly, I got a group!

 Solution Outline $x_3 = f(x_1, x_2)$ satisfies $\frac{1}{x_3} = [x^0]\left[\big(x + \frac{1}{x_1}\big)\big(x + \frac{1}{x_2}\big)\text{.</description>

      <description>Introduction Our team Black Bauhinia participated in the TetCTF 2022 which spans two days. Shares is an interesting two-part challenge. Mystiz and I (grhkm) spent around 10 hours in total on this challenge, $4$ on the first part and $6$ on the second.
Problem Statements  Description: Yet another secret sharing scheme.

      <description>Introduction After my absolute failure attempt to solve zipfel in \langlehxp CTF 2021\rangle(https://ctftime.org/event/1447), I have decided for the $n^{\text{th}}$ time to seriously learn Elliptic Curve Cryptography. This time, hopefully I will finally understand pairings, supersingular curves and isogeny crypto. After all, I want to be a cool guy too!
\langleblockquote class=&amp;ldquo;twitter-tweet&amp;rdquo;\rangle\langlep lang=&amp;ldquo;en&amp;rdquo; dir=&amp;ldquo;ltr&amp;rdquo;\rangleIsogeny crypto is what cool guys do these days: walking around graphs of supersingular elliptic curves.\langlebr\rangle\langlebr\rangleI&#39;ve written yet another brief introduction to it, using the many great resources available.</description>

      <description>Solved by: grhkm and TWY
Source of the problem: SECCON CTF 2021
Problem Statement  Great research on witch has made it possible to split and duplicate messages.

 Solution Outline We found a (partial) general formula for exponent of an upper triangular matrix and solved the equations by comparing the entries.
Initial Observations We are given a matrix version of RSA. Essentially, we were asked to solve the matrix equation</description>

Summary of Problem Statement  寧願不揀最易的路 行極還未到
寧願你最後未傾慕 但信念安好
在意的 不再是 愛的煩惱
是哪樣做人 更清高
餘生那段旅途
與哪類人共舞

 the-hardest-path_e00c6aa7b64b8dc2a06e577937b5b07c.zip   Solution Outline We have to find a path (represented by NEWS - North, East, West, South) from source _328518a497015157 to _8b0eb6f195ae182a, which is done by constructing call relationship graph and performing shortest path algorithm (such as Dijkstra&amp;rsquo;s).</description>

Solved by: grhkm and Kaiziron
Source of the problem: HKCERT CTF 2021
Problem Statement  All codes are uncertain before the measurement, and you will never make it.
Observe the code to get the flag.
nc chalp.hkcert21.pwnable.hk 28132
 Solution Outline We dump the binary from 0x400000 to 0x405000 using format string and %8$s, then reverse engineer the check function for the flag.</description>
