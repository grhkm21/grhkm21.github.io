      <description>Introduction Our team Black Bauhinia participated in the TetCTF 2022 which spans two days. Algebra is the hardest Crypto challenge in the CTF. Mystiz and I (grhkm) together spent around 7 hours on this challenge.
Problem Statement  Description: I threw some arbitrary operator into a finite field and, interestingly, I got a group!

 Solution Outline $x_3 = f(x_1, x_2)$ satisfies $\frac{1}{x_3} = [x^0]\left[\big(x + \frac{1}{x_1}\big)\big(x + \frac{1}{x_2}\big)\text{.</description>

      <description>Introduction Our team Black Bauhinia participated in the TetCTF 2022 which spans two days. Shares is an interesting two-part challenge. Mystiz and I (grhkm) spent around 10 hours in total on this challenge, $4$ on the first part and $6$ on the second.
Problem Statements  Description: Yet another secret sharing scheme.

      <description>Introduction After my absolute failure attempt to solve zipfel in \langlehxp CTF 2021\rangle(https://ctftime.org/event/1447), I have decided for the $n^{\text{th}}$ time to seriously learn Elliptic Curve Cryptography. This time, hopefully I will finally understand pairings, supersingular curves and isogeny crypto. After all, I want to be a cool guy too!
\langleblockquote class=&amp;ldquo;twitter-tweet&amp;rdquo;\rangle\langlep lang=&amp;ldquo;en&amp;rdquo; dir=&amp;ldquo;ltr&amp;rdquo;\rangleIsogeny crypto is what cool guys do these days: walking around graphs of supersingular elliptic curves.\langlebr\rangle\langlebr\rangleI&#39;ve written yet another brief introduction to it, using the many great resources available.</description>

      <description>Solved by: grhkm and TWY
Source of the problem: SECCON CTF 2021
Problem Statement  Great research on witch has made it possible to split and duplicate messages.
problem.sage 8df65d6861d69ed6d461c5cd70b7157040534a0c
output.txt 2cf4e086b11751dfe9eaf758d26f8f0a765458d2
 Solution Outline We found a (partial) general formula for exponent of an upper triangular matrix and solved the equations by comparing the entries.
Initial Observations We are given a matrix version of RSA. Essentially, we were asked to solve the matrix equation</description>
