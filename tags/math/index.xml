      <description>I have decided to take on the topic of Modular Forms. I don&amp;rsquo;t intend to dive too in depth into the topic, since it is obviously a rich theory and has many prerequisites. However, I will try to get a basic understanding of what is it about and what the theory tries to answer.

Prerequisites We begin by considering the modular group $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$, defined as all $2 \times 2$ matrices with determinant $1$:</description>

      <description>Please note that $p$ does not denote a prime, but instead usually an integer $p \geq 0$.
Existing lemmas Definition by recurrence:
$$ B_n = 1 - \sum_{k = 0}^{n - 1} \binom{n}{k} \frac{B_k}{n + 1 - k} $$
$$ B_n(x) = \sum_{k = 0}^n \binom{n}{k} B_{n - k}x^k $$
Faulhaber&amp;rsquo;s theorem:
$$ \sum_{k = 0}^{n - 1} k^p = \sum_{i = 0}^p B_i \binom{p + 1}{i} \frac{n^{p + 1 - i}}{p + 1} $$</description>

      <title>Finite Realm of Random (498 points, 4 solves)</title>

      <description>Introduction Our team Black Bauhinia participated in the idekCTF 2023 which spans two days. Finite Realm of Random was an interesting math / crypto puzzle. In the end, only 3 teams solved it the intended way, and we were the second.
Problem Statement Description: I took a flag, and shuffled it. I took a part, and randomized it. I took the bits and pieces, and scattered them across the field. Now, only an haphazard mess remains.</description>
