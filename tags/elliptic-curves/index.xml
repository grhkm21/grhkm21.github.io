      <description>This is a short note on Jacobi quartics and its relationship with elliptic curves.
Definition An elliptic curve in Jacobi quartic form is a curve of the form $J_a: y^2 = x^4 + 2ax^2 + 1$, where $\det(J)$, which is some multiple of $a^2 - 1$ here, is nonzero. This model of elliptic curves is important as it provides quicker point arithmetic. We shall prove that the curve $J_a$ is birationally equivalent to $E_a: 2v^2 = u^3 - 2au^2 + (a^2 - 1)u$.</description>
