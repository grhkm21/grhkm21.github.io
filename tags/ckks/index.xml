      <description>(Up-)Solved by: grhkm
Source of the problem: Dice CTF 2022
Self-Reflection I am actually very frustrated and annoyed at myself for this problem. During the CTF I was scared off by my lack of experience with this encryption scheme, and also just didn&amp;rsquo;t believe I can solve this challenge. As a result, I spent a lot of my time watching YouTube instead.
Approaching the end of the CTF, for absolutely no reason I decided I will try to take a look at the challenge.</description>
